We generated the ribo file using RiboFlow (https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/riboflow) via the following command:

nextflow RiboFlow.groovy -params-file project.yaml -profile docker_local

The file project.yaml, used above is available online at https://github.com/ribosomeprofiling/riboflow/blob/master/project.yaml .

For this run, we used the sequencing files and the metadata in the GitHub repository:
